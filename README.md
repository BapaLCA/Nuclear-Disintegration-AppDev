# Nuclear-Disintegration Dev

Project includes source code for PIC18F4550 programm for measuring, Python Application to control and retrieve measured, EXE build of Python Application (found in 'pythonApp/dist'), 3D model of a box made for MIKROE-1280 board and CSV files of measure examples.

Application was made to be used alongside the PIC18F4550 microprocessor programm for ULB nuclear disintegration experiment
Modules folder contains the different Python scripts used by the main python script for developpig data processing application
PIC18F4550 was initially made to work on a MIKROE-1280 Ready for PIC board with its box (3D model available in folder 3dmodel)
